# 🧮 Infix to Postfix Expression Evaluator (C++)

This project is a C++ application that converts mathematical expressions from **infix** notation to **postfix** (Reverse Polish Notation), and then evaluates them using a **stack**.

## 🔧 Features

- Converts infix expressions (e.g., `3 + 4 * 2`) to postfix (`3 4 2 * +`)
- Evaluates postfix expressions using stack-based logic
- Handles operator precedence and parentheses
- Includes 5 automated test cases

## 📁 Files

- `expression.cpp` – Infix to postfix conversion and postfix evaluation functions
- `main.cpp` – Test runner and example use cases

### 📌 Note
This project was developed as part of a data structures course assignment, with a focus on implementing stack-based expression evaluation.
